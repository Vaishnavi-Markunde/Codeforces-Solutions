# Codeforces Solutions
Here we'll upload solutions for recent codeforces contests. Open to contribute, just create a PR with your solution (properly commented)
<br>
<br>
Steps to follow while uploading your solution:
- Navigate to the Rounds folder (if the one you want isn't there , create one)
- Create a folder for each problem if not present named < round_number >
- Upload your solution (source code with comments would work) as Q_NAME.cpp 
- Make sure you file name contains language details too if you're uploading doc/pdf.

Happy Coding!
